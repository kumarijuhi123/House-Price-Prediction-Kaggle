Aligning Training and Testing Data\n\nThere need to be the same features (columns) in both the training and testing data. One-hot encoding has created more columns in the training data because there were some categorical variables with categories not represented in the testing data.

(This is true for the most part as the winning models, at least for structured data, all tend to be variants on [gradient boosting](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/01/23/a-kaggle-master-explains-gradient-boosting/)). This represents one of the patterns in machine learning: feature engineering has a greater return on investment than model building and hyperparameter tuning. [This is a great article on the subject)](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/secret-to-data-science-success/). As Andrew Ng is fond of saying: \"applied machine learning is basically feature engineering.\" \n\nWhile choosing the right model and optimal settings are important, the model can only learn from the data it is given. Making sure this data is as relevant to the task as possible is the job of the data scientist (and maybe some [automated tools](https://docs.featuretools.com/getting_started/install.html) to help us out).\n\nFeature engineering refers to a geneal process and can involve both feature construction: adding new features from the existing data, and feature selection: choosing only the most important features or other methods of dimensionality reduction. There are many techniques we can use to both create features and select features.\n\nWe will do a lot of feature engineering when we start using the other data sources, but in this notebook we will try only two simple feature construction methods: \n\n* Polynomial features\n* Domain knowledge features\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"70322dd11709dcaaf879a56103fde8fc787b7d4c","_cell_guid":"464705a1-7ecf-47ba-a1fe-9f870102eb85"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Polynomial Features\n\nOne simple feature construction method is called [polynomial features](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html). In this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` and `EXT_SOURCE_2^2` and also variables such as `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` x   `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, and so on. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called [interaction terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics) because they  capture the interactions between variables. In other words, while two variables by themselves  may not have a strong influence on the target, combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. [Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/interpreting-interactions-in-regression/) to capture the effects of multiple variables, but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Nonetheless, we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. \n\nJake VanderPlas writes about [polynomial features in his excellent book Python for Data Science](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.04-feature-engineering.html) for those who want more information.\n\nIn the following code, we create polynomial features using the `EXT_SOURCE` variables and the `DAYS_BIRTH` variable. [Scikit-Learn has a useful class called `PolynomialFeatures`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) that creates the polynomials and the interaction terms up to a specified degree. We can use a degree of 3 to see the results (when we are creating polynomial features, we want to avoid using too high of a degree, both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree, and because we can run into [problems with overfitting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py)).

Let's use a slightly more sophisticated model for our actual baseline: Logistic Regression.\n\n## Logistic Regression Implementation\n\nHere I will focus on implementing the model rather than explaining the details, but for those who want to learn more about the theory of machine learning algorithms, I recommend both [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) and [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do). Both of these books present the theory and also the code needed to make the models (in R and Python respectively). They both teach with the mindset that the best way to learn is by doing, and they are very effective! \n\nTo get a baseline, we will use all of the features after encoding the categorical variables. We will preprocess the data by filling in the missing values (imputation) and normalizing the range of the features (feature scaling). The following code performs both of these preprocessing steps."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"784ae2f91cf7792702595a9973ba773b2acdec00","_cell_guid":"60ef8744-ca3a-4810-8439-2835fbfc1833","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, Imputer\n\n# # Drop the target from the training data\n# if 'TARGET' in app_train:\n#     train = app_train.drop(columns = ['TARGET'])\n# else:\n#     train = app_train.copy()\n    \n# # Feature names\n# features = list(train.columns)\n\n# # Copy of the testing data\n# test = app_test.copy()\n\n# # Median imputation of missing values\n# imputer = Imputer(strategy = 'median')\n\n# # Scale each feature to 0-1\n# scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range = (0, 1))\n\n# # Fit on the training data\n# imputer.fit(train)\n\n# # Transform both training and testing data\n# train = imputer.transform(train)\n# test = imputer.transform(app_test)\n\n# # Repeat with the scaler\n# scaler.fit(train)\n# train = scaler.transform(train)\n# test = scaler.transform(test)\n\n# print('Training data shape: ', train.shape)\n# print('Testing data shape: ', test.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"364f0835a46f7a7bb7be487b54d92f5ff50ed341","_cell_guid":"1bcfab25-cc1c-4553-9473-96fcfeb2a61a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will use [`LogisticRegression`from Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) for our first model.

We first made sure to understand the data, our task, and the metric by which our submissions will be judged. Then, we performed a fairly simple EDA to try and identify relationships, trends, or anomalies that may help our modeling. Along the way, we performed necessary preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, and scaling features to a range. Then, we constructed new features out of the existing data to see if doing so could help our model. \n\nOnce the data exploration, data preparation, and feature engineering was complete, we implemented a baseline model upon which we hope to improve. Then we built a second slightly more complicated model to beat our first score. We also carried out an experiment to determine the effect of adding the engineering variables. \n\nWe followed the general outline of a [machine learning project](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-machine-learning-walk-through-in-python-part-one-c62152f39420): \n\n1.  Understand the problem and the data\n2. Data cleaning and formatting (this was mostly done for us)\n3. Exploratory Data Analysis\n4. Baseline model\n5.  Improved model\n6. Model interpretation (just a little)\n\nMachine learning competitions do differ slightly from typical data science problems in that we are concerned only with achieving the best performance on a single metric and do not care about the interpretation. However, by attempting to understand how our models make decisions, we can try to improve them or examine the mistakes in order to correct the errors. In future notebooks we will look at incorporating more sources of data, building more complex models (by following the code of others), and improving our scores. \n\nI hope this notebook was able to get you up and running in this machine learning competition and that you are now ready to go out on your own - with help from the community - and start working on some great problems! \n\n__Running the notebook__: now that we are at the end of the notebook, you can hit the blue Commit & Run button to execute all the code at once. After the run is complete (this should take about 10 minutes), you can then access the files that were created by going to the versions tab and then the output sub-tab. The submission files can be directly submitted to the competition from this tab or they can be downloaded to a local machine and saved. The final part is to share the share the notebook: go to the settings tab and change the visibility to Public. This allows the entire world to see your work! \n\n### Follow-up Notebooks\n\nFor those looking to keep working on this problem, I have a series of follow-up notebooks:\n\n* [Manual Feature Engineering Part One](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering)\n* [Manual Feature Engineering Part Two](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering-p2)\n* [Introduction to Automated Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/automated-feature-engineering-basics)\n* [Advanced Automated Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/tuning-automated-feature-engineering-exploratory)\n* [Feature Selection](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-feature-selection)\n* [Intro to Model Tuning: Grid and Random Search](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/intro-to-model-tuning-grid-and-random-search)\n\nAs always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.

I added this code just to show what may be in store for this project, and because it gets us a slightly better score on the leaderboard.
